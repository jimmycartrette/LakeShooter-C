# LakeShooter-C

My goal is to use this to get proficient coding in C and lower level programming. It's heavily inspired by "River Raid", an Atari 2600 game I liked.

Controls buttons are Z and X
You can play at https://jimmycartrette.github.io/LakeShooter-C/

So far I've used bitwise operations and pointer arithmetic to check collision by inspecting the framebuffer drawings of land.

TODO:
Level restart should look the same, but currently it does not the first time.
Add hornets
Add houses/decorations on land
Glide up to bridge like original game
Alter speeds and start possibility of movement a bit earlier for enemies
