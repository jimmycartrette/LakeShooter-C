# LakeShooter-C

My goal is to use this to get proficient coding in C and lower level programming. It's heavily inspired by "River Raid", an Atari 2600 game I liked. In fact, I stole some of the sprites and will attempt to duplicate the river generation from that game, so the river will be exactly the same.

Controls buttons are Z and X

So far I've used bitwise operations and pointer arithmetic to check collision by inspecting the framebuffer drawings of land.
